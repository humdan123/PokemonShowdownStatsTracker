# PokemonShowdownTools
Is a set of tools to help with statistics collection from the application Pokemon Showdown.

Function: 
Takes the chat log from a recorded Pokemon Showdown game and updates a Google Sheets file based off how many kills and deaths a certain pokemon has.

To run:
1. Copy and paste the chat logs from the game session you are trying to load onto the file named "input.txt"
2. Run the file "run.py"
3. Insert the Pokemon Showdown names of the two people who were fighting in the chat log. P1 is the player who's perspective the replay is based off of, P2 is the other player.
